# ADR-003: Agent Providers (Mistral, Gemini)

- Date: 2025-10-04
- Status: Proposed

## Context
We want pluggable LLM agents for the hunter and minotaur roles.

## Decision
Provide minimal wrappers for Mistral and Google Generative AI (Gemini) with environment-configured API keys.

## Consequences
- Pros: Flexibility to swap models/providers; clear separation of concerns.
- Cons: Requires external API keys; potential cost and rate limits.
