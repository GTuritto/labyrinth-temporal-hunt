  - Win/lose condition detection
  - Structured GameStateResponse with Pydantic validation

### 🔄 **2. LangGraph Turn Loop**
- **✅ 4-Node Architecture** (`src/graph/turn_loop.py`)
  - `user_turn_node`: Parse human input (JSON + natural language)
  - `gsm_apply_user_node`: Apply user commands to game engine
  - `minotaur_turn_node`: Generate AI decisions based on proximity
  - `gsm_apply_minotaur_node`: Execute minotaur actions

- **✅ Advanced Features**
  - Flexible input parsing ("move north 5" → structured commands)
  - Smart minotaur AI with distance-based behavior
  - Single turn vs. continuous game loop modes
  - Complete JSON serializable logging
  - Robust error handling with safe fallbacks

### 📋 **3. Type-Safe Contracts**
- **✅ Pydantic Models** (`src/gsm/models.py`)
  - UserInput: Commands with validation and defaults
  - MinotaurDecision: AI actions with coordinate targeting
  - GameStateResponse: Complete game state with strict validation
  - Parsing functions with safe fallbacks

### 🎮 **4. Modern Web Interface**
- **✅ Streamlit UI** (`src/ui/app.py`)
  - Real-time game state display (position, stamina, turn, status)
  - Interactive command buttons and custom text input
  - Live environment updates (paths, items, inventory)
  - Minotaur status visualization with emojis
  - AI agent integration with conversation memory
  - Turn history with expandable JSON logs

### 🤖 **5. AI Agent Integration**
